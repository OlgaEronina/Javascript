    Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say <br>
    that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last <br>
    people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, <br>
    because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
</div>
<div id="secondTab" class="tabItem">
    Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made <br>
    drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did <br>
    have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had <br>
    nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she <br>
    spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the <br>
    neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their <br>
    opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
</div>
<div id="thirdTab" class="tabItem">
    The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and <br>
    their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't <br>
    think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. <br>
    Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; <br>
    in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her <br>
    sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was <br>
    possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would <br>
    say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the <br>
    Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy <br>
    was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want <br>
    Dudley mixing with a child like that.
</div>
<div id="fourthTab" class="tabItem">
    When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story <br>
    starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that <br>
    strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the <br>
    country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for <br>
    work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming <br>
    Dudley into his high chair.
